        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Breakfast, lunch, tea time, and dinner - this popular Indian pancake is available for a meal or snack. As kids we ate it sprinkled with sugar. It's typically served with curry and sambal if you choose to spice it up.</p>

        <h2>Ingridents</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>3/4 warm water</li>

        <li>1 teasponn salt</li>

        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>

        <li>4 cups all purpose flour</li>

        <li>3 tablespoon clarified butter</li>

        <li>1 egg</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>

        <li>2 tablespoon ghee</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>

        <li>
            Mix warm water, salt, and sugar together in a bowl. Put flour in a large mixing bowl; work in 3 1/2 tablespoons ghee using your fingertips.</li>
        <li>Beat egg and 1 teaspoon water together in a bowl; add to flour mixture. Gradually mix warm water mixture into flour mixture while kneading until dough becomes soft and pliable. Form dough into balls and let rest in a well-oiled bowl, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        
        <li>Working on a flat greased surface, take a dough ball and flatten it using the heel of your palm to make a paper-thin circle. Spread 1 teaspoon ghee inside it. Fold the edges together to make roti into a square. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>

        <li>Heat about 1 tablespoon ghee on griddle or in a skillet over medium heat; cook roti until browned, 1 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
